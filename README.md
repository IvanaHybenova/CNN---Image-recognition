# CNN---Image-recognition
Building of CNN  for cats and dogs image recognition


Repository contains .py file for building a CNN with single image prediction and the dataset.

Dataset is split into multiple parts, in order to make code work, create folder named "dataset" with two folders "training_set" and "test_set". In both training_set and test_set create two folders "dogs" and "cats" and copy paste there corresponding images.

CNN-tunning.py contains winnig solution of CNN optimization of the deep learning course.
